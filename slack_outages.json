This happens to users who've done a hard refresh in the app after around 12:53 PM PST. We recommend users to avoid doing a hard refresh in the meantime.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, users can access the channel from the sidebar, channel browser or quick switcher. \r\n\r\nOur team is actively working on a fix. Thank you for your patience while we solve the issue."
