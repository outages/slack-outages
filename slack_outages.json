We’re actively looking into this, and we’ll report back as more information becomes available.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you may be able to open the admin page with the following workaround:\r\n\r\n1. Sign in to your workspace in a web browser (https://slack.com/signin).\r\n2. Click your workspace name to open the menu, then click ‘Settings & administration’ > ‘Manage members’.\r\n\r\nNote: Our original understanding was that this only affected Enterprise Grid customers. It seems like this is not the case, and we've updated the title and description to reflect that."
